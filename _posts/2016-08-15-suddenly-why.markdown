There are several times in my career, I seriously take attempts to maintain a personal blog site. But It never happened.

In last months I was thinking how many times I personally get benefitted by other person blogs. Sometimes my whole day got saved by reading a post from a random developer, who wrote that blog post just for his own reference. There are several times I got highly motivated, from a writing by a random people just sharing their experience.

Also as I am growing as a person and as a developer, the idea of keeping track of my idea's, may it be random personal philosophy or technical hacks, keeps getting stronger.

I don't know if the above words make any sense but yes that basically is my reason to take another attempt to start serious blogging.

So Here I am, In this blog site I'm expecting to share my insights, ideas, and opinions on various subject matters.

Oh BTW there will be some technical posts too !! :)

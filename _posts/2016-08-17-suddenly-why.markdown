Several times in my career, I seriously took attempts to maintain a personal blog. But It never happened.

In last few months I was thinking how many times I personally benefitted from someone else's blog. Sometimes I saved a whole day by reading a blog post from a random developer, who maybe wrote that blog post just for his own reference or maybe to share his experiences. Several times I got highly motivated from simple blog posts like that.

As I am growing as a person and as a developer, the very idea of keeping track of my ideas keeps getting stronger even if they are some random personal philosophy or technical hacks.

I donâ€™t know if the above words make any sense but yes... that basically is my reason to take another attempt to start some serious blogging.

So Here I am, In this blog site I will share my insights, ideas, and opinions on various subject matters.

Oh BTW there will be some technical posts too !! :)
